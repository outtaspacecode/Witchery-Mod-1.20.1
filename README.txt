A mod originally by Emoniph.

Due to the extensive protective nature of the language around the original Witchery mod made by
Emoniph, this mod will most likely never come close to being able to be published for the general
public.

This mod recreation is a passion project, as it is hands down my favorite mod ever made. It is very sad
to me that it has now been discontinued for the better part of a decade, and it is for that reason that
I decided to remake it. As has been stated, almost certainly I will not be able to publicly release the
mod, so it will boil down to my own sole personal use. It pains me to know that many will likely never
even know the greatness of the Witchery mod.

I hope to be able to reach out to Emoniph and gain permission to release this mod to the public,
however I am not hopeful.


The original CurseForge description of the mod:
"Witchery allows players to explore the magical art of witchcraft and though it, to learn to control the natural magic present in the world (and sometimes other dimensions).

 Witchery provides several branches of witchcraft for a new witch or warlock to try their hand at. Witchcraft does not really resemble the flashy spell-casting performed by wizards and their ilk. There are no lightning wands or spell books, enchanted armor or flaming swords; instead, a well tended witch's garden will provide a lot of helpful ingredients for magic that will get you out of the occasional scrape.

 There are of course darker sides to magic; and although these may bring power more quickly, the cost may be too high. Making bargains with demons should never be undertaken lightly!

 Notable features:
  - Witches Garden
  - Brewing with a Kettle
  - Poppets and Voodoo Dolls
  - Dream Weaving and Spirit World dimension
  - Circle Magic and Rituals
